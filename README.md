# sandboxp
A sandbox for Multi-Threaded, Multi-Process, Multiple Processor, Cluster and Networked Cluster Parallell Processing

Sandboxp is intended to be an exploratory work area for various scenarios that may benefit from the application of paralellism in multiple processes.  The primary motivation is to explore design principles in such a way that they can be applied to various parts of a flight simulation program.
